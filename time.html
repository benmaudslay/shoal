  <h2>time</h2>

  <p>Time is an expansive subject in cinema, prominent from its earliest stages, and remaining equally, perhaps more relevant in contemporary viewership. 
</p>

<p id="quote">“From its inception, cinema has privileged time. The essence and the appeal of the cinematic art are inextricable from the experience of temporality that it offers spectators” (Furby, 2015, p. 248).  
</p>

<p>This simple manipulation of time in a narrative context, achieved primarily through the editing process, can be seen in virtually every film made. No matter the subject they are exploring, films intrinsically take temporality as a secondary focus due to the nature of the medium. Whether they explore temporality in linear terms, or nonlinear, it is always present when a narrative is being presented to an audience. Due to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gGl3LJ7vHc&ab_channel=esteticaCC">Kuleshov effect</a>, presenting an image in sequence with another forces the human brain to make connections for better or for worse. This is of course not an accurate representation of our actual perception of time in reality. An authentic representation of time was first unknowingly realised by early actualities, which were experiments in discovering how film cameras worked rather than artistic expressions; nonetheless, they solidified moments in time. This line of thought has been revitalised in recent times, in part this is because of rapid developments in technology which allow for extended recording times per take. Flowering from such technological advancements came a bustling cinema movement which aims to capture narratives in real-time. Approximating actual experiences of time heightening realism for the audience, in addition to challenging assumptions of how time can be displayed in cinema. 
</p>

<p>So far we have only assessed a style of filmmaking that situates time as a component of narrative construction. It can, however, more noticeably be positioned as a story device unto itself. These films often involve a form of time travel, which can frequently disrupt a linear presentation, fragmenting the narrative throughout the film to eventually reconcile and consolidate it fully in the last act. It is also possible to present such narratives linearly, however these films will similarly contain a moment of realisation where the story is consolidated for the viewer. Perhaps the ultimate form of the time film is François Truffaut’s Antoine Doinel series and Richard Linklater’s Before Trilogy. Both directors take a set of characters and revisit them throughout periods of their lives. Unextraordinary you might think, doesn’t every film attempt this? Well yes, however, Truffaut and Linklater go one step further and not only revisiting the characters but the same actors years after the preceding film. If viewed in close succession we can see them as linear time travel films that hold added authenticity as they are actually stitching together multiple temporal events. This particular style of filmmaking is epitomised in Linklater’s <i>Boyhood</i> (2014) which brings together scenes filmed over a twelve-year period. Snippets of a boy’s life are presented next to each other with no differentiation between each period. The result can be equated to memories of a childhood. This method of using film as a moving photo album manipulates the viewer's desire for nostalgia, leading to heightened identification and emotional connection. No matter its manifestation, time plays a significant part in every film.

<p>Shoal’s curated programme of films covers many of the concepts about time discussed in this essay. We have selected a film a day, starting from 1st until the 24th December, that illustrates interesting areas highlighted in this article.
